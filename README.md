The purpose of developing this app is practising `Redux-middleware`.   
I always use Function Components in web development, in this app I used `Class Component` because I believe some developers are still using it so it is a good opportunity to do some practice.  
The latest react-redux provides many useful API, e.g. `useSelector()` and `useDispatch()`, they are very powerful but I didn't use them as well. The reason is that I don't know them before developing this app:sweat_smile:.
